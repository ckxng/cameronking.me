## Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of
United States, which governing law applies to agreement without regard to its
conflict of law provisions.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to
be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms
will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us
regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might
have had between us regarding Service.

## Changes To Service

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or
material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will
not be liable if for any reason all or any part of Service is unavailable at
any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some
parts of Service, or the entire Service, to users, including registered users.

## Amendments To Terms

We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is
your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.

Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means
that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page
frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become
effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to
the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use Service.

## Waiver And Severability

No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be
deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of
any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to assert a right or
provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such
provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the
remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.
