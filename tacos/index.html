<p>This Website has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for the

<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT COMPANY SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE,

THIRD PARTY WEB SITES OR SERVICES THAT YOU VISIT.</p>
<h2 id=limitation-of-liability>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU WILL HOLD US AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS HARMLESS FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, HOWEVER IT ARISES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES AND
ALL RELATED COSTS AND EXPENSES OF LITIGATION AND ARBITRATION, OR AT TRIAL OR ON
APPEAL, IF ANY, WHETHER OR NOT LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION IS INSTITUTED),
WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, OR

<h2 id=governing-law>Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of
United States, which governing law applies to agreement without regard to its
conflict of law provisions.</p>
<p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to
be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms
will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us
regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might
have had between us regarding Service.</p>
<h2 id=changes-to-service>Changes To Service</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or
material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will

<p>We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is
your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means
that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page
frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.</p>

<h2 id=waiver-and-severability>Waiver And Severability</h2>
<p>No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be
deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of
any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to assert a right or
provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p>If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such
provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the
remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>
